# BasicPHP2013

## Repo Naming
This repo created to upload old basic code when start to pickup PHP around 2013. Why didn't uploaded back then if you ask, I can answer, I'm not really seriously to put my code online and at that time where GitHub are not free like we have now. So, after a while I re-thinking to upload my previous code (whether it's old or new recently created).

## What Change
Previously this part developed with PHP 5, so it still using mysql object instead of mysqli object. To make sure it runs with latest PHP versions, so I update the object code from mysql to mysqli
